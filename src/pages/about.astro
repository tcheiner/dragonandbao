        <p>Hey there! We're based in Amsterdam, where bare-faced efficiency rules... but, in the most delicious ways possible. 🍴✨</p>

        <p>So, what do a bao, rice ball, burrito, dumpling, sandwich, empanada, pasty, hand pie, and pot pie all have in common?</p>

        <p>Besides being totally drool-worthy, they’re the ultimate one-handed wonders! Perfect for five paw pads (or, you know, human hands), these little bundles of joy are quick to grab, easy to pack, and ready to fuel your day whenever hunger strikes. Basically, they are variations of a protein lovingly wrapped in a cozy carb hug. 🥟❤️</p>

        <p>Why are we so obsessed with these handheld, time-tested, ridiculously versatile bites? Well, we’re an on-the-go family with a mix of OCD, ADHD, and a sprinkle of autism.</p>

        <p>Life moves fast, and we need food that can keep up—with zero compromises on health, flavor, or fun.</p>

        <p>We want to share tasty adventures as we explore just how creative, delicious, and downright exciting rice balls and bento lunches can be.</p>

        <p>Let’s roll (pun intended) into a world of handheld happiness! 🍙✨</p>
