# Old fashioned Beef Stew

## Ingredients
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
- 1 pound beef stewing meat, trimmed and cut into inch cubes
- 5 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 cup red wine
- 3½ cups beef broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 medium onion, peeled and chopped
- 5 medium carrots, peeled and cut into ¼-inch rounds
- 2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into ¾-inch cubes
- 2 teaspoons salt

## Instructions
1. Combine the flour and pepper in a bowl, add the beef and toss to coat well. Heat 3 teaspoons of the oil in a large pot. Add the beef a few pieces at a time; do not overcrowd. Cook, turning the pieces until beef is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch; add more oil as needed between batches.
2. Remove the beef from the pot and add the vinegar and wine. Cook over medium-high heat, scraping the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Add the beef, beef broth and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a slow simmer.
3. Cover and cook, skimming broth from time to time, until the beef is tender, about 1½ hours. Add the onions and carrots and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more. Add broth or water if the stew is dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle among 4 bowls and serve.

## Notes
- How to thicken beef stew
    - Starches, like the flour, cornstarch and potatoes, thicken beef stew. Sometimes, beef cubes are coated in flour,
then browned, leaving flour in the pan while sealing flour to the meat. When the meat is later simmered, that flour thickens the liquid as do potatoes, which release their starches as they cook. Cornstarch is often stirred with cold water into a slurry that's then simmered in the cooking liquid to thicken it.
- How to cook beef stew in a slow cooker
    - For additional ease, beef stew can be prepared in a slow cooker or crock pot. You can try a slow cooker
variation of beef stew in this recipe or prepare any beef stew through the step when everything is simmering together, then transfer to a slow cooker and continue cooking until the meat is tender.
- How to make beef stew on the stove
    - It’s important to cook stew slowly over low heat. High heat will cause the meat to tighten and toughen, while
low heat allows the meat to become fall-apart tender. Simply cover the pot, leaving a small gap for steam to escape, and keep the heat as low as it goes.
- What to serve with beef stew
    - The best accompaniments to beef stew can soak up the sauce. A crusty baguette works well, as does rice. A beef
stew is hearty enough to be a one-pot meal, but you can make a salad with some crisp, fresh vegetables.
