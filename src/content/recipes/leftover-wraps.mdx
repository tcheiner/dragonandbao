# Leftover Wraps: Greek, Mexican Burrito, Chinese

## Ingredients
- Aluminum foil
- 1 large or extra-large mexican tortillas
- leftover meat: diced, sliced, or shredded
- veggies: lettuce, tomatoes, pickled onions, leftover roasted vegetables, avocado, cucumbers (sliced thin)
- sauce: Greek yogurt, ranch dressing, salsa, hummus, tzatziki, or any other sauce you like
- cheese: feta, mozzarella, cheddar, or any cheese you like

## Instructions

1. Wrap your leftover meats up.
2. Layer cheese on first (so it melts), then meats, then sauces (so veggies sticks to the meat), then veggies.
3. Roll up the tortilla tightly, folding in the sides as you go.
4. Wrap the tortilla in aluminum foil to keep it warm and toasty.
5. Heat a skillet over medium heat and place the wrapped tortilla seam-side down (you want to rotate and heat all
slice so you get a nice grill line and melt the cheese).

## Notes:
- **Greek Wrap:** Use leftover grilled chicken, feta cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and tzatziki sauce.
- **Mexican Burrito:** Use leftover shredded beef or chicken, black beans, rice, salsa, cheese, and avocado.
- **Chinese Wrap:** Use leftover stir-fried vegetables, sliced chicken or beef, hoisin sauce, and shredded cabbage
(tossed with some salt a few minutes before wrapping).
