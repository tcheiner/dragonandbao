# Kaya (Coconut) Jam

## Ingredients
- 5 eggs
- 200 ml coconut milk, 1 cup
- 120 g sugar, 1/2 cup or 4 oz.
- 3 pandan leaves, tie into a knot
- 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 1/2 tablespoons water, mix the cornstarch and water together
- Caramel:
    - 75 g sugar, 6 tablespoons

## Instructions
1. Crack the eggs into a large bowl, then add the coconut milk and sugar. Whisk well by hand.
2. Strain the mixture into a non-stick saucepan and add the pandan leaves. Cook on low heat, stirring continuously to avoid burning, for about 20 minutes. Add the cornstarch mixture to thicken the coconut jam. Turn off the heat and discard the pandan leaves. (Note: The jam may appear lumpy.)
3. In another saucepan, heat the sugar over medium-high heat until it melts into caramel. Once it turns golden brown, remove from heat and add it to the kaya and stir well. The kaya should turn golden brown.
4. Transfer the kaya to a blender and blend until smooth and lump-free. Spread on toast to make kaya toast. Store the leftover in a jar in the fridge for up to a week.

## Notes
- As for the eggs, you can totally adjust based on your taste. My aunt told me you can use anywhere between 3 to 5
eggs, so it’s really up to you. I personally like my coconut jam rich, so I go with 5 eggs. Also, I prefer my kaya to be thicker in texture— I’m not a fan of that “watery” kaya that makes my toast soggy. The thicker, the better for me!
- Always go for a non-stick saucepan! It keeps the kaya from sticking or burning and makes cleanup so much easier. No
stubborn bits stuck to the bottom.
- The key to silky coconut jam is constant stirring. I always keep the heat low and stir non-stop—don’t step away!
- The last thing you want is scrambled eggs in your kaya. Keep an eye on the heat and make sure it stays low so it
doesn’t burn.
- I’ve noticed that sugar in the USA tends to be a bit weaker compared to what we use in Malaysia, so you might find
your kaya a little too sweet. Just adjust the sugar to your taste—don’t be afraid to cut it down to get that perfect balance!
- If you prefer a lighter color, you can use 50g of sugar for the caramel— I used 75g for that richer brown hue.
