<slot name="instructions">
    1. Primed Yeast

       Mix yeast and water. Let sit in warm area ten minutes before using.

       Dough

       Incorporate yeast and water mix into dry ingredient bowl using medium-low speed.

       Gradually add butter, then mix 2-3 more minutes until fully mixed and elastic.

       Proof for 15 minutes with damp towel on top.

       Divide do into 8 pieces weighing 127 g.

       Lightly shape dough in a fat log 4 in or 1 cm long.

       Place in baking sheet greased with oil. Cover with damp towel or plastic wrap and let rest for 5 minutes.

       When shaping pretzel dough, start from center, increase pressure as you reach ends to get a tapered effect until getting a long tapered torpedo 20 in or 50 cm long (think about a giant earthworm here, fat in the middle skinny on the ends).

       Take the two ends, bring them together, gently cross over each other.

       Twist end pieces once, gently bring it down to front and attach those legs to the base line on oiled sheet tray, cover and proof for 30 min.

       Put in fridge to cool, prep lye solution
       LYE SOLUTION: 1000 g cold water to 30g of food grade lye beads. Whisk until all are dissolved. IMPORTANT: USE GLOVES!

       Drop in solution 10 seconds per side. Place on wire rack setup over drain excess lye mixture. Make sure rack is greased otherwise it sticks.

       Slash base or thickest part of pretzel with razor blade

       Finish with flaky salt, then bake at 425 F or 218 C for 15-20 min or until golden brown.</slot>

    - **Measuring Flour:** Aerate the flour before measuring to avoid dry dough.
    - **Baking Tips:** Use a convection oven if possible. Bake on the middle rack in a fully preheated oven.
