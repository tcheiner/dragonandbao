# Homemade Cola

## Ingredients
- 1 quart water
- Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
- Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime
- Finely grated zest and juice of 2 oranges
- 3 large (5-inch) cinnamon sticks, broken into small pieces
- 2 tablespoons dried bitter orange peel
- 2 teaspoons coriander seed
- 1/4 teaspoon finely grated nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon gum arabic (optional)
- 2 pounds sugar
- 1/4 cup browning sauce, such as Kitchen Bouquet
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract


## Instructions

1. To make the natural cola syrup: Combine water, lemon zest, lime zest, orange zest, cinnamon, bitter orange peel, coriander seed, nutmeg, and gum arabic (if using) in a large saucepan. Whisk together until the gum arabic dissolves. Stir in sugar and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil for 1 minute.
2. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon, lime, and orange juices, along with browning sauce and vanilla. Let cool,
then strain.
3. To mix with seltzer: Pour 1/2 cup cola syrup into a tall glass. Add 1 1/2 cups seltzer and stir until just blended.
Add ice and serve.
4. To carbonate with a siphon: Combine 3 1/4 cups water and 3/4 cup cola syrup in a 1-quart siphon. Charge with CO2
according to the manufacturer's directions. Siphon charged sodas can be stored in the siphon in a refrigerator for up to 5 days. Dispense as desired into tall glasses filled with ice and serve.
