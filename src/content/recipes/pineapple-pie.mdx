description: "I peel pineapple the same way my mom (and probably every other Filipino mom) does: carved into the\
shape of a fusilli noodle, the eyes whittled away in a diagonal spiral leaving rippled ravines in the fruit’s golden flesh. Pineapple pie is a Philippine bakeshop specialty. The crust is a little breadier than your typical pie crust, owing to yeast or, in this case, baking powder. My trick to ensure an extra crispy, sturdy crust is to preheat a sheet pan on the lowest oven rack for 30 minutes. This is essentially a DIY pizza stone. Scorching the bottom crust right away is vital because there is a lot of custardy filling on top and this isn’t the kind of pie you can blind-bake./
If you love pineapple as much as I do, you’ll be tempted to eat the filling straight up. It’s sweet, fruity, and refreshing, and I’ve found that a bit of orange zest amplifies its brilliant citrusy profile. A generous shower of turbinado sugar is sprinkled on top before it bakes, which adds a satisfying crunch and a gorgeous glimmer (a simple way to upgrade any pie or pastry, really). I skip the silverware and eat this the Filipino way, kamayan (by hand)."

## Ingredients
- Filling
    - 4 large egg yolks
    - 25 oz. (715 g) fresh pineapple, cubed
    - ½ cup (120 g) water
    - ½ cup (66 g) cornstarch
    - 2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar
    - 1 tsp. kosher salt
    - 2 Tbsp. (28 g) unsalted butter
    - ½ tsp. vanilla bean paste or extract
    - Grated zest of 1 orange
- Pastry Crust
    - 4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
    - 2 tsp. kosher salt
    - 1 stick (113 g) cold unsalted butter, cubed
    - 6 Tbsp. (60 g) vegetable shortening, cold
    - ½ cup (120 g) heavy cream, cold
    - ½ cup (120 g) ice water
    - 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tbsp. water, for egg wash
    - Turbinado sugar, for sprinkling
- Special Equipment
    - 1 quarter-sheet pan (13x9"/33x23 cm)

## Instructions
- Filling
    - Step 1: In a medium bowl, add 4 large egg yolks. Set beside the stovetop.
    - Step 2: In a blender or food processor, puree 25 oz. (715 g) fresh pineapple, cubed, until smooth.
    - Step 3: In a large saucepan, whisk together ½ cup (120 g) water and ½ cup (66 g) cornstarch. Whisk in the pineapple
    puree, 2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar, and 1 tsp. kosher salt. Heat over high heat, whisking constantly, until warm and steaming, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.
    - Step 4: Gradually whisk about half of the warm pineapple mixture into the yolks. Then whisk the yolk mixture back
    into the saucepan. Cook over high heat, whisking constantly, until bubbles are bursting on the surface and the mixture is very thick and glazy (like a thick lemon curd), 3–5 minutes.
    - Step 5: Remove from the heat and whisk in 2 Tbsp. (28 g) unsalted butter, ½ tsp. vanilla bean paste or extract,
    and grated zest of 1 orange. Transfer the filling to a large bowl or liquid measuring cup. You should have about 4
    cups (1,200 g). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours.

    - Step 6: In a food processor, add 4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour, 2 tsp. kosher salt, and 1½ tsp. baking powder and
    pulse to combine. Add 1 stick (113 g) cold unsalted butter, cubed, and 6 Tbsp. (60 g) vegetable shortening, cold, and pulse until they’re broken up into small bits. Add ½ cup (120 g) heavy cream, cold, and pulse to distribute. Add ½ cup (120 g) ice water and pulse until the mixture looks like crumbled dough.
    - Step 7: Transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface. Gather into a uniform mass. Divide the dough into 2 equal
    portions (about 460 g each) and shape each into a flat disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
    - Step 8: To assemble: Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll out one disk of dough into a 15x12" (38x30-cm)
    rectangle.
    - Step 9: Transfer the dough to a quarter-sheet pan, letting the excess dough hang over all sides. Add the chilled
    filling and spread into an even layer.
    - Step 10: Roll out the second disk of dough into a 15x12" (38x30-cm) rectangle.
    - Step 11: Place the dough over the pineapple filling. (Try to get the placement correct the first time! The dough will
    stick to the filling, so it’s hard to adjust once it’s on there.)
    - Step 12: Pinch together the overhanging dough and tuck under itself like you would for a regular double-crusted pie.
    Shape into a neat crust (this will be fairly tall and thick). Using kitchen shears, trim slivers of dough off the top of the crust and reshape until you have a thick (but not too thick) crust all the way around.
    - Step 13: Brush the dough all over with 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tbsp. water and poke all over with a fork (make sure
    there are actual holes not just imprints). Sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Freeze for 15 minutes. Then refrigerate for 15 minutes.
    - Step 14: Meanwhile, place a foil-lined standard half-sheet pan on the lowest oven rack position and preheat to 350°F
    (180°C) for 30 minutes.
    - Step 15: Place the pineapple pie on the hot sheet pan and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 1 hour.
    - Step 16: Transfer the pie (still on the sheet pan) to a wire rack. Don’t worry if the pie is leaking in a few spots.
    If the pastry looks slightly raised, gently press it down with a rubber spatula to expel any air. Let cool for 1 hour.
    - Step 17: Invert the pie onto a wire rack. Then invert again onto another wire rack so it sits right side up. Let cool
    completely, about 1½ hours.
    - Step 18: Slide the pie onto a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, cut the pie into 4 equal rectangles. Cut each
    rectangle in half vertically into smaller rectangles (not super skinny ones). You should have 8 equal rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally into 2 triangles.
    - Step 19: Enjoy at room temperature or refrigerate and serve chilled (which I like better).
