# Pear Almond Cake

## Ingredients
- 250 g all-purpose flour or baking flour, sifted or aerated (see note below)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 200 g white granulated sugar
- 113.4 g salted butter melted
- 2 eggs
- 236.59 ml plain low-fat Greek yogurt
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract or Amaretto liqueur
- 3 medium pears firm texture, cored and peeled
- 46 g sliced almonds

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. If your oven has a convection setting, use a convection bake setting. Line the bottom of the 9x3-inch springform pan with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, mix flour and baking powder.
3. In a large bowl, combine sugar, melted butter, and eggs, and beat using a whisk for about 1 or 2 minutes until the mixture becomes smooth, light in color, and fluffy.
4. Mix in Greek yogurt, vanilla, and almond extract, and whisk just until combined.
5. Add the flour mixture gradually, adding 1 cup at a time. Do not over-mix.
6. Chop one peeled and cored pear into small chunks. Fold the chopped pear into the cake batter.
7. Pour the cake batter into the parchment paper-lined springform pan. Arrange pear slices tightly on top of the cake in a circular pattern. Top with sliced almonds.
8. Bake for about 50 minutes or 1 hour until the tester comes out clean. Remove the cake and let cool before serving.

## Notes
- **Measuring Flour:** Aerate the flour before measuring to avoid dry dough.
- **Baking Tips:** Use a convection oven if possible. Bake on the middle rack in a fully preheated oven.
