description: "This banana bread definitely leans toward dessert, thanks to thick swirls of chocolate-hazelnut spread.
Browning the butter may seem a little fussy, but it's totally worth the time and effort. The resulting toasty warm flavor pairs perfectly with sweet bananas and the rich spread. After all, the French term for brown butter is “beurre noisette” which literally translates to hazelnut butter."

# Nutella Banana Bread

## Ingredients
- ½ cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), plus more for greasing the pan
- 2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring the pan
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1½ cups/310 grams mashed bananas, from about 3 medium bananas
- ⅔ cup/134 grams granulated sugar
- ¼c up/57 grams plain Greek yogurt
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup/99 grams chocolate-hazelnut spread, like Nutella

## Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.
2. Stir the flour, baking soda and salt together in a bowl.
3. Brown butter: Melt butter in a light-colored saucepan over medium heat. Cook butter, occasionally scraping the bottom and sides of the pan with a rubber spatula until it turns a deep golden brown and smells nutty. Don’t walk away from the pan during this process. The butter will go from browned and nutty to acrid and burnt in moments. Transfer butter to a large heat-safe mixing bowl and let it cool slightly.
4. When the butter has cooled a bit, add the mashed bananas, sugar, yogurt, eggs and vanilla extract. Stir until well combined, then add the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
5. Pour half the batter into prepared pan and spread it evenly with a knife or offset spatula. Spoon half the chocolate-hazelnut spread in several dollops over the top and use a toothpick or skewer to swirl it into the batter. Spoon and spread the remaining batter over the top followed by dollops of the remaining spread. Swirl in the spread, then bake the bread for 55 to 60 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
