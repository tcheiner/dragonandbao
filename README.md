Beautifully crafted with Astro.js, and Tailwind CSS — Simple & easy to customise.

## This template is using Tailwind CSS V4

Now we are using only a CSS file. It's called `global.css` and it's located in the src/styles folder. Now we are eimporting Tailwind CSS on the same file instead of using the `tailwind.config.cjs` file. Like this:

```css
// Importing Tailwind CSS
@import "tailwindcss";
// Importing Tailwind plugins
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
@plugin "@tailwindcss/forms";
```

Then to add your styles you will use the @theme directive. Like this:

```css
@theme {
  /* Your CSS goes here, see how styles are written on the global.css file */
}
```

Remember this is just in Alpha version, so you can use it as you want. Just keep an eye on the changes that Tailwind CSS is going to make.


## Template Structure
Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:
```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── components/
│   └── layouts/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│   └── styles/
└── package.json
```
Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
## Commands

| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
